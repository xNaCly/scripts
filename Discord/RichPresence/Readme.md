# RichPresence for Discord

## Creates a Discord RichPresence for you

### What you need to do:
   - install python and download the latest rpc.py [release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xNaCly/scripts/master/discord/richpresence/rpc.py)
   - install following packages:<br>
               `pypresence`
               `win32gui`

### How it works:
   - gets the current focused window and adds it to your RichPresence in Discord <br>
   - updates every 15 seconds<br>
   - uses assets providen by me, will be changed later to more neutral pictures
   - logs all activity in a `log` file, which can be found in the same directory as `rpc.py`



### In Discord: <br>
