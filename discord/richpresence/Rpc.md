# RichPresence

### What you need to do:
   nothing besides installing python or downloading the latest release

### How it works:
   - gets the currently focused window and adds it to your RichPresence in Discord <br>
   - updates every 15 seconds<br>
   - uses assets providen by me, will be changed later to more neutral pictures




# Optimised for Windows
