# Format Hexadecimal-data

## Extreme specific usage:
- only used to format hexadecimaldata to a easier readable Format (Pairs of 2, Capital letters)

## Usage:
 - takes one parameter, which contains the file with the data to format in it:
    ```
      filename.ending => [hexadata.txt]
    ```
## Warning:
 - the script replaces the file content with the newer formated content!
